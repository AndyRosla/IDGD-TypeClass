# IDGD-TypeClass Portfolio

This project serves as a portfolio for my web font-design class, where I've been learning to combine fonts effectively. It consists of an `INDEX.html` file, which acts as the main entry point and links to four additional pages representing my class assignments. The primary purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my work to my classmates and teacher.
